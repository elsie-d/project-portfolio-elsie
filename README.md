## About Me

*This section will show status of learnings.*

So far in the course I've learned to structure pages with **HTML**, style with **CSS**, and add functinality wit **JavaScript**.

I've also learned to work with different CSS fameworks such as **Bootstrap**, **Bulma**, **Materialize**. 

On top of that, I can say I am now comfortable with fetching data from third party **API's** as well as store and use **JSON** to format the data.
